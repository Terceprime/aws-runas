A friendly way to do AWS STS AssumeRole operations so you can perform AWS API actions using a particular set of permissions.
Includes integration with roles requiring MFA authentication!  Works off of profile names configured in the AWS SDK configuration file.

The tool will cache the credentials retrieved from AWS in order to minimize API calls to AWS, as well as minimize the entry
of MFA codes (for roles requiring MFA).

Full documentation for downloading, configuring and running aws-runas can be found [here](https://mmmorris1975.github.io/aws-runas/)

Since it's written in Go, there is no runtime dependency on external libraries, or language runtimes, just download the
compiled executable and "go".


## Installing

## Building

### Build Requirements

Developed and tested using the go 1.12 tool chain and aws-sdk-go v1.18.6  
*NOTE* This project uses [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for dependency management

### Build Steps

A Makefile is included with the source code, and executing the default target via the `make` command should install all dependent
libraries and make the executable for your platform (or platform of choice if the GOOS and GOARCH env vars are set)

## Contributing

The usual github model for forking the repo and creating a pull request is the preferred way to
contribute to this tool.  Bug fixes, enhancements, doc updates, translations are always welcomed.
